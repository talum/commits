# Commits

## Intro
An app that serves up the hilarious GitHub commit messages from an old colleague. It leverages the GitHub GraphQL API to pull all commit messages that aren't merges. This is a Phoenix app with a React front-end.

## Developing

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
